#2.4.10   LAB   Operators and expressions

##Scenario

Take a look at the code in the editor: it reads a <mark>**float**</mark> value, puts it into a variable named <mark>**x**</mark>, and prints the value of a variable named '''**y**'''. Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the following expression:

**3x<sup>3</sup> - 2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x - 1**

The result should be assigned to y.

Remember that classical algebraic notation likes to omit the multiplication operator â€’ you need to use it explicitly. Note how we change data type to make sure that <mark>x</mark> is of type <mark>float</mark>.

Keep your code clean and readable, and test it using the data we've provided, each time assigning it to the "x" variable (by hardcoding it). Don't be discouraged by any initial failures. Be persistent and inquisitive.

**Sample input**
<mark>
x = 0
x = 1
x = -1
</mark>

**Sample output**
<mark>
y = -1.0
y = 3.0
y = -9.0

</mark>
